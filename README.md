# DemoBlaze_Testing
End-to-end manual testing project on the DemoBlaze e-commerce app using JIRA
📋 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete manual software testing process performed on the DemoBlaze
 e-commerce web application.
It was executed as part of a professional QA practice to simulate real-world testing workflows — from requirements analysis to release management — using JIRA (Zephyr) for test management and Excel for documentation and reporting.

👤 Role

Sole QA Tester — responsible for designing, executing, and managing all testing activities.

🎯 Project Objectives

Practice end-to-end manual testing on a real web application.

Apply testing lifecycle principles: Requirements → Design → Execution → Reporting → Release.

Utilize JIRA + Zephyr for traceability and defect management.

Document all testing artifacts professionally.

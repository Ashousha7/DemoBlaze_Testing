# 🧪 DemoBlaze Website Testing Project

## 📋 Overview  
This project demonstrates a complete **manual software testing process** performed on the [DemoBlaze](https://www.demoblaze.com/) e-commerce web application.  
It was executed as part of a professional QA practice to simulate **real-world testing workflows** — from requirements analysis to release management — using **JIRA (Zephyr)** for test management and **Excel** for documentation and reporting.

---

## 👤 Role  
**Sole QA Tester** — responsible for designing, executing, and managing all testing activities.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Practice **end-to-end manual testing** on a real web application.  
- Apply **testing lifecycle principles**: Requirements → Design → Execution → Reporting → Release.  
- Utilize **JIRA + Zephyr** for traceability and defect management.  
- Document all testing artifacts professionally.

## 🧠 Testing Workflow  
1. **Requirements Analysis** – Extracted and reviewed user stories to identify key functionalities.  
2. **Test Design** – Created detailed test scenarios and cases with expected results.  
3. **Test Execution** – Executed functional tests on DemoBlaze and logged results in Zephyr.  
4. **Defect Tracking** – Reported issues in JIRA, maintaining traceability to corresponding user stories.  
5. **Usability Evaluation** – Conducted a basic usability assessment and summarized findings.  
6. **Release Reporting** – Compiled release report and enhancement proposal based on test results.
